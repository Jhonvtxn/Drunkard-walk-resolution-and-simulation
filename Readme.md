#Drunkard-walk
This present work, we approach the Walk of the Drunk using Markov Chain, absorbent case, having as main objective the resolution of this problem. With that, an algorithm was implemented in Python capable of calculating the probability of the drunk's steps, taking into account that he can arrive both at home and at the bar. For the same, the Canonical Form of the Transition Matrix, Fundamental Matrix and Spectral Decomposition was calculated. Therefore, after analyzing the results obtained, it was possible to know the highest probability of the drunk's position in the long run.
